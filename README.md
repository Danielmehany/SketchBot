# SketchBot
SketchBot is a LEGO EV3-based robot designed to automate the creation of precise multi-view engineering drawing outlines. Programmed in RobotC, it reads dimensions (length, width, and separation) from a file and determines the number of shapes via button input. The robot features a three-axis movement system: a Y-axis platform for length movement, an X-axis scaffold for width, and a drawing arm that controls the pencilâ€™s vertical motion. Enclosed in a metal frame with an emergency stop feature and alignment markers, SketchBot ensures near-perfect accuracy while operating twice as fast as manual drawing.
